# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This is a nodejs server generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

### How to Connect with Customized UI

1. Specify the location of customised ui folder: https://github.com/jincongho/mfswagger-nodejs-server/blob/master/index.js#L37

2. Load the correct swagger specification from the ui index.html: https://github.com/jincongho/mfswagger-nodejs-server/blob/master/swagger-ui-master/src/main/resources/microfocus-config.js#L19 (can be flexible, rather than fixed value shown in example)

* the customised ui can be extracted to another repository and install using package.json, the inclusion of the ui in this repo is just to show the connection clearer
* more customised setting of the running behaviours are possible
